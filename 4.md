1. What is the @Autowired annotation and how is it used in Spring

@Autowired is one of the core annotations in Spring, used for automatic dependency injection. In simpler terms, it allows Spring to automatically wire the required beans (dependencies) into your classes, eliminating the need for manual configuration.
meaning Spring will look for a bean of the matching type in the application context and inject it.

2. What is the purpose of the @Bean annotation in Spring, and how does it differ from the @Component annotation?
   
@Bean is used to explicitly declare a bean in Spring's application context. @Component is a general-purpose annotation used to indicate a Spring-managed component.

The main difference between @Bean and @Component annotations is that @Bean is used to declare a method that returns a bean, while @Component is used to mark a class as a bean. Another difference is that @Bean is usually used in configuration classes, while @Component is usually used in component classes. A third difference is that @Bean allows you to customize the name, scope, and initialization of the bean, while @Component relies on default settings or other annotations. For example, you can use @Scope, @Lazy, or @DependsOn annotations with @Bean methods, but not with @Component classes.

1. What is the purpose of the ApplicationContext in Spring, and how does it differ from BeanFactory?

ApplicationContext represents the Spring IoC container that holds all the beans created by the application. It is responsible for instantiating, configuring, and creating the beans. Additionally, it gets the beans' information from configuration metadata provided in XML or Java.

BeanFactory loads beans on-demand, while ApplicationContext loads all beans at startup. Thus, BeanFactory is lightweight as compared to ApplicationContext. Letâ€™s understand it with an example.
