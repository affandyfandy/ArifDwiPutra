Q: What is advantages and drawbacks of DI ?

**Advantages**

The main advantages of dependency injection are:

Logical separation. Loose coupling between components and dependencies makes code easier to read and maintain. Classes and objects do not handle dependency instantiation or management.

Improved testing. DI simplifies unit testing. Creating mock dependencies or testing individual components is simplified.

Flexible dependency management. Separating dependencies and components provides flexibility. Different dependencies can be injected, which creates an easily adaptable environment.

Reusable components. Due to loose coupling between components and dependencies, the code is reusable in different contexts and environments.

Simpler maintenance. Upgrading libraries or components does not affect the underlying dependent class.

Concurrent development. Developers can work on modules and dependencies in parallel while adhering to the defined contracts.

**Disadvantages**

The disadvantages of dependency injection are:

Complexity. When handling many dependencies or complex configurations, DI additionally increases code complexity.

Learning curve. The concepts behind DI and when to apply them take time to grasp fully. Initial project development slows down due to the learning curve.

Overhead. DI is not suitable for smaller projects, as it adds redundant overhead.

Runtime errors. Dependencies that are not carefully injected result in runtime errors. Troubleshooting is challenging, especially in complex environments.
