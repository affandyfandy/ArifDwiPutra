1. Compare 3 types of Dependency Injection. Which one is better? Which one is recommended?

**Constructor Injection**

- Constructor injection is the process of using the constructor to pass in the dependencies of a class.

- You should use constructor injection when your class has a dependency that the class requires in order to work properly.

- If your class cannot work without a dependency, then inject it via the constructor.

you should use constructor injection when the dependency in question has a lifetime longer than a single method. Dependencies passed into the constructor should be useful to the class in a general way, with its use spanning multiple methods in the class. If a dependency is used in only one spot, method injection

**Property Injection (aka setter injection)**

You should use property injection in case the dependency is truly optional

- Property Injection however causes Temporal Coupling and when writing Line of Business applications, your dependencies should never be optional: you should instead apply the Null Object pattern.

- property injection is considered bad in 98% of all scenarios because it hides dependencies and there is no guarantee that the object will be injected when the class is created. (ref)

- The built-in IoC container does not support property injection. You will have to use a third-party IoC container.

**Method Injection**

- Thus method injection is useful in two scenarios: when the implementation of dependency will vary, and when the dependency needs to be renewed after each use. In both cases, it’s up to the caller to decide what implementation to pass to the method.

**Which one is better:**

Constructor Based Dependency Injection is the most recommended dependency injection technique in the Spring Framework. This technique involves passing all necessary dependencies for an object as arguments to the constructor. The object is created only after all necessary dependencies have been provided.

2. Research about “Circular dependency injection”. Explain and give example

A circular or cyclic dependency is a situation where two or more independent modules or components rely on each other to function properly. This is referred to as mutual recursion.

AA circular dependency occurs when a bean A depends on another bean B, and the bean B depends on bean A as well:

Bean A → Bean B → Bean A

Of course, we could have more beans implied:

Bean A → Bean B → Bean C → Bean D → Bean E → Bean A

**For example**

class A needs class B, and class B also needs class A. Circular dependencies can arise in Nest between modules and between providers. While circular dependencies should be avoided where possible, you can't always do so.
